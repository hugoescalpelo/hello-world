Hello world.

This is a getting started exercise
to learn Git, GitHub, GitHub Desktop and Atom.

I just made an stage from Atom, even if I still
don't know what stage is.

I did some changes and uploaded successfully via GitHub Desktop,
found some errata, added some dots and checked over github.com
that the changes are on server side. Hahaha, I think "server side"
means something else.

Now I'm going to click some cute arrows in my Atom window
and see what happens.

Wow. Now I see. Those nice arrows open a menu with pull and
push buttons. How I see, push button works like the button
next to the button subtitled with 'master branch'; Fetch I think.

And all the changes can be tracked from the history tab in
GitHub Desktop. I also learn that you need to stage changes to
be able to commit them.

Now I'm trying the Amend Button.

Nice, now I have a (1) next to push and pull button. I don't
know what to do. Let's stage and commit.

Great! now i have a push (1) and a pull (2). I'm going to
stage and commit this comments and then click on Fetch, by the way,
I'm still at Atom's window and the Fetch button appears nest to
push and pull on the "nice arrows" button on what now I can see,
its the Git pane, not the GitHub pane.

Well, now I really have no idea what happens and for Amend and Pull is for.
But, after some commits, merged errors, stages and a click on push (4),
the changes were reflected on github.com and GitHub Desktop.

Now I'm trying pull firsts
Trying again

Confused again, lets try fetch first.

Now let's try a new branch.

Jeje, it turns out "A Branch" is an invalid name for a branch.
I wonder if it's because a reserved name or because it should be
a no space name.
