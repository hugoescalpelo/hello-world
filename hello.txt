Hello world.

This is a getting started exercise
to learn Git, GitHub, GitHub Desktop and Atom.

I just made an stage from Atom, even if I still
don't know what stage is.

I did some changes and uploaded successfully via GitHub Desktop,
found some errata, added some dots and checked over github.com
that the changes are on server side. Hahaha, I think "server side"
means something else.

Now I'm going to click some cute arrows in my Atom window
and see what happens.

Wow. Now I see. Those nice arrows open a menu with pull and
push buttons. How I see, push button works like the button
next to the button subtitled with 'master branch'; Fetch I think.

And all the changes can be tracked from the history tab in
GitHub Desktop. I also learn that you need to stage changes to
be able to commit them.

Now I'm trying the Amend Button.
